Automated geometric network tracing using Python and ArcGIS
=================

This repo contains two python scripts that are configured to trace geometric networks that represent storm drain systems.  They are configurable to be used with other geometric networks that require velocity and flow time calculations such as sewer and water systems.  There are also Microsoft Visio and .pdf workflow documents to represent the script logic.

This project acts as a culminating experience for my Master's of Arts in Geography and G.I.S. from the California State University at Northridge.  The scripts are open for anyone to fork or you can open a pull request to submit any suggested corrections and/or improvements.
